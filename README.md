Questions for Vijaya
1. Can you please share the Databricks workspace URL which you want monitored along with the token which i can use to setup connection between my terraform workspace to Databricks

2. For the Databricks URL and token, I have parameterised the script but for running it on production, we need either terraform secrets or the Variables file in Terraform cloud portal

3. In the ticket it is mentioned to have a time based automation for running the script at 4 AM CST everyday, now we could have used cron job on a server for this but since we are using terraform cloud, it doesn't have the feature to run time based automation.

4. For emailing, Do we have any SMTP service that we need to integrate in our terraform code or can we setup the emailing using Terraform cloud portal?
